// NewParagraphFallback creates a paragraph that mixes scripts in a single
// string by dispatching each script run to the first face in fb that
// covers its base codepoint. Internally the paragraph is built as N
// TextRuns, one per (face, substring) segment, so the rest of the
// pipeline (shaping, measurement, drawing, subsetting, ToUnicode) runs
// unchanged on each segment.
//
// Phase 1 scope: cross-script fallback only. A whole script run (per UAX
// #24, with Common/Inherited resolved against neighbours) is locked to a
// single face so that per-script shapers (Arabic positional joining,
// Devanagari cluster formation, GPOS mark-to-base) see a coherent input.
// Within-script coverage gaps -- e.g. a Latin face missing U+1E9E -- are
// not yet resolved and will render as .notdef tofu; this is a Phase 2
// extension that requires per-cluster face dispatch with shaper
// coordination.
//
// Pointer identity: the *EmbeddedFont pointers stored on Fallback are
// passed verbatim into the generated TextRuns. The page-level font
// resource map dedupes by pointer, so the document still emits one
// Type0 font dict per underlying face regardless of how many paragraphs
// share the Fallback.
//

// to the first face. Consecutive script runs that resolve to the same

// measurement see a flat, minimal run list.

// An empty text input yields a single empty segment bound to the first

// at least one run, so the rest of the layout pipeline (which assumes

// Common codepoint that has nothing to do with the run's resolved
// script. Probing on it would route the whole run to whatever face
// covers space/punctuation first (typically the Latin face), even
// when the run is Hebrew or Arabic.
//
// To avoid that miss, walk forward to the first rune whose own script
// matches the run's resolved script. That rune is the script's natural
// "base" and represents the coverage requirement for the segment. For
// pure-Common runs (e.g. "..."), no rune satisfies the match; return
// the first rune so the caller still has something to probe.
